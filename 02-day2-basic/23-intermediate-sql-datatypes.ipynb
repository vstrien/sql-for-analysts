This determines the type of data that fits in, and the detail with which data is stored. A full list of data types can be found in the Microsoft docs - but instead of giving you the link, [just google for \"t-sql data types\"](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=t-sql+data+types) to find the docs. It will come in handy as a reference in this module (plus, the habit of looking up documentation this way will serve you well as SQL Server user).\r\n\r\nAs soon as you are on the Microsoft Docs about SQL Data Types, notice the link on the left that says **Precedence**. This is the one that tells you which data type will be automatically converted into another data type. Don't worry about storing this page: it will almost always be easier to test how it works in SQL than to read the docs about precedence. Just remember the phrase in case you need it :-).",
