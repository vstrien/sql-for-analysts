# Trainer Guide

## Setup and slides

During this day, few slides are ever needed. It's way more important to have several good (tiny) examples to work with and gradually display on whiteboard / flipover.

For example:

* customer, name + id (Albert, Bill, Cecilia)
* products with inherent categories (Apple, Bike, Car) name + id. Where needed, add things like listprice, category, color, stock level, etc.
* order (customer id, product id, date). Maybe quantity, unit price, discount, tax, subtotal

With this basic material, explain concepts like:

Besides the "dry" material, also use the AdventureWorks-databases on the training machines. Concepts like selecting, sorting and filtering are easier explained on a training machine.

The "dry" material is way better for explaining joins:

* cartesian products (three tables, max. two columns)
* combine with filter for inner join
* left join (filtering, but making sure that every row for the "left" table is preserved at least once)
* right join
* full join

Datatypes can better be explained using the sample databases.

## Day planning

### Block 1 - 9:30-10:30

Getting to know each other
Find out the everyone's goals for this course
Having everyone get a VM
(If there's time: start with module 1. Otherwise get coffee around 10:45)

### Block 2 - 10:45-12:00

Getting a good feeling for current knowledge level + module 1

### Block 3 - 12:45-14:45
Inner & Left Join

### Block 4 - 15:00-17:00
SQL Datatypes

The Challenge
